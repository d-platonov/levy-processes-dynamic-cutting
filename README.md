# Dynamic Cutting Approach for Simulating Some LÃ©vy Processes

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to simulate alpha-stable and tempered-stable processes. The implementation is based on the numerical examples (4.1 and 4.2) provided in the paper [...]:

## Files Description

- `alpha_stable_process.py`: Defines the `AlphaStableProcess` class, which includes methods for simulating alpha-stable Levy processes.
  
- `approximation_type.py`: Contains the `ApproximationType` enumeration, which specifies the method for simulating alpha-stable processes.

- `monte_carlo.py`: Implements Monte Carlo methods for estimating moments and cumulants of the alpha-stable and tempered-stable processes, leveraging the simulations from `alpha_stable_process.py`.

- `run_simulation.py`: A script that coordinates the running of Monte Carlo simulations for both alpha-stable and tempered-stable processes.

## Usage

To run the simulation and view the results, execute the following command:

```bash
python run_simulation.py
